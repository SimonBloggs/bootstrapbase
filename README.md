#Joomla! Bootstrap Template Framework.

## Templates
All templates are located in the /templates directory.

### BootstrapBase Template
The BootstrapBase template provides a simple Joomla! template which has been completely "boostrapified". It includes all the files required for responsive web design using Bootstrap (http://www.getbootstrap.com).

### Bootstrap Integration

#### Javascript
The Bootstrap framework includes a single bootstrap.js file designed to combined all Bootstrap Javascript functionality (tab.js, scrollspy.js, tooltip.js, dropdown.js, etc).

#### LESS
It is strongly recommended all Bootstrap Template Framework templates use LESS to manage and maintain Joomla!'s CSS. LESS improves CSS readability, code re-use and allows for the use of 3rd party tools to cutomize the template via easy-to-use UI tools.

Using LESS also results in a single CSS file being created which reduces traffic to and from the site.
